# Django Channels Chat App

Channels is a project that takes Django and extends its abilities beyond HTTP - to handle WebSockets, chat protocols, IoT protocols, and more. Itâ€™s built on a Python specification called ASGI.

It does this by taking the core of Django and layering a fully asynchronous layer underneath, running Django itself in a synchronous mode but handling connections and sockets asynchronously, and giving you the choice to write in either style.
